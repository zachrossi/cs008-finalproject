        <h1>The History of PlanetBay</h1>
        <p>Only six years after graduating from the University of Vermont, three young men with an entrepreneurial
            spirit and a dream to one day combine their passions of real estate and space exploration started a small
            company called Extraterrestrial Property Management (EPM). With numerous recent advancements in space
            travel by NASA, tens of thousands of planets in the Milky Way Galaxy had already been discovered and
            meticulously analyzed. Additionally, traveling to planets became as inexpensive as an airplane ticket
            was in the early 2000s. Tyler Eisenmenger, Zachary Rossi, and Joshua Deland saw an opportunity to
            take advantage of the vast expanse of planets. The three developed an intricate legal process for an
            individual or organization to purchase a planet and have complete rights to the resources on their
            planet. After receiving approval from United Nations to greenlight the "Extraterrestrial Property
            Management" website and mobile application, orders came rushing in, mainly from the elite 0.001% and
            from Global 500 companies who wanted to take advantage of external resources. With the influx of
            orders, EPM signed an agreement for NASA to become the official provider of spaceships for real estate
            tours and resource transportation. After only eight months on the market, multi-billionaire Jeff Bezos
            acquired EPM as a subsidiary of Amazon.com Inc. and renamed the company to PlanetBay, which is what it
            is known as today. Since the acquisition, PlanetBay has grown by a record-breaking 15,391%. Despite
            growing competition, we remain the world's largest distributor of extraterrestrial property.
